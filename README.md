## What does this do?
This allows you to experiment with basic [`PPC Assembly`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC) code directly on your computer.

## Why is this useful?
It saves you the trouble of running assembly on a PowerPC-based system since computers generally use [`x86 assembly`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language) so PowerPC is not natively supported. Also, by using the interpreter you will not crash if you access a bad memory address for instance and you can try again immediately.

## Where can I download the application?
[Here](PowerPC%20Assembly%20Interpreter.jar?raw=true).

## What are the requirements to run this?
[You only need to have Java installed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t58ZrfkI2PM).

## Why are so many instructions unsupported?
Because it takes a lot of time to implement them. Progress on this might be made later on. Have a look through the source code to find out what is supported. It should be easy to tell.
